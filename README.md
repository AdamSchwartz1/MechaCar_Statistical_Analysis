# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
## Purpose
I will be helping a car manufacturer, AutosRUs', analyze their production data for their newest model, the MechaCar. I will be performing 4 tests in this analysis:
- Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
- Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
- Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
- Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers.
